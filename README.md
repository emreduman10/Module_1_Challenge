## Overview and Origin:

* Lemonade, Inc. (1)

* Incorporated in 2015 (1).

* The founders are Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger (1).

* The idea for Lemonade came about by creating a revolutionary insurance company that generates profits in a unique way in order to give back to the community and help improve the public (2). More on this in the Business Activities section below.

* Lemonade raised $481.5M in funding over 12 rounds. SoftBank is one its 7 leadi investors. The most recent funding was on 7/2/20 in a Post-IPO Equity round (1). Lemonade's IPO Date is 7/2/20 and it was valued at $1.6B with an initial share price of $29.00 (1).


## Business Activities:

* Lemonade seeks to offer insurance services while also giving back to the community. Lemonade sells renters, homeowners, car, pet, and life insurnace to its customers in a transparent, competitive, and hassle-free manner (2). While Lemonade is a for profit corporation, it is also a public benefit corporation. At the end of each fiscal year, Lemonade uses left over premiums and donates them back to nonprofit organizations of each customer's choice. Lemonade takes a flat fee out of the premium as profit and rolls over the left over money after claims and expenses to charitable foundations (2). This is called Lemonade Giveback (2).

* Lemonade's target customer demographic is the underserved market of millenials and first-time insurnace buyers (3). First-time insurance buyers comprise 87% of Lemonade's customers (3). Lemonade attracts these customers with its simple and appealing advertising and easy-to-use and interactive AI chat bot, Maya (3, 4). Compared to other emerging InsureTech competitors, such as Hippo, which mainly provides home insurance, and Root, which primarily provides car insurance, Lemonade offers a full fleet of insurnace services (5). Combining Lemonade's scope of product with their interactive AI chat bot, user-friendly interface, and initiative to give back to the community, Lemonade renders itself as an extremely resonating choice for customers (5). This can be seen in Lemonade's rapid growth: it took just 4 years to reach 1 million customers while it took established insurance provider, State Farm, two decades to achive the 1 million customers milestone (5).

* Lemonade most evident technology that it uses is AI, which it leverages to have chat bots automatically perform the task of speaking with customers and calculating their insurnace quotes (6). This enables Lemonade to replace call center agents with machine learning; everything is clean, crisp, and instantaneous (6). Per Stackshare, Lemonade uses applications such as Python, NGINX, CloudFlare, TypeScript, Ruby, Rails, and Swift to implement its technology (7).


## Landscape:

* Lemonade is in the InsureTech domain of Fintech (1).

* Some major trends in InsureTech in recent years are listed below:
    * **Predictive Analytics** - using data to dynamically adjust quotes. So, just as quicky as customers modify their information they provide on a quote, they receive adjustments in their estimated price in real-time (8). Predictive Analytics has made InsureTech that much more efficient (8).
    * **Artificial Intelligence** - AI is integral to reducing the risk of human error (8). InsureTech companies can utilize AI when serving their customers such that customers are not misquoted (8). This saves time and money from being invested into a customer service operation that would have to remediate errors made during policy inception. Ultimately, AI has increased customer satisfaction (8).
    * **Virtual Assisstants (Chatbots)** - chatbots are available 24/7 and greatly reduce the investment needed to organize, train, and maintain a customer service department (8). InsureTech companies that utlize chatbots can acquire and service customers in a much quicker manner than those that rely on conversation via phone call (8).

* Some of the largest InsureTech companies by total funding are listed below (data provided by Crunchbase) (9):
    * **Oscar** ($1.6B) - Health Insurance platform
    * **Bright Health** ($1.6B) - hHealth Insurance platform
    * **Clover Health** ($1.3B) - Health Insurance platform
    * **Next Insurance** ($881M) - Insurance plaform for SMEs
    * **Hippo Insurance** ($709M) - Home Insurance
    * **Root Insurance** ($527.5M) - Auto Insurance


## Results:

* Since its founding in 2015, Lemonade has captured the attention young and first-time insurance buyers (10). Lemonade has grown rapidy and now has over 1 million customers (12) of which approximately 65% are under the age of 35 (10). The social impacts of Lemonade via the Lemonade Giveback program has certainly aided its customer attraction and retention (10). The unique business model challenges legacy insurance companies such as State Farm, Progressive, and Allstate to name a few (10). While these more traditional insurance companies still wield a commanding slice of the market, Lemonade has paved the way to one day become one of the most prominent insurance companies in the world (10).

* Some core metrics in InsureTech are listed below (11):
    * **Average Premium Cost** - in 2020 the average premium per Lemonade customer was $213 (12). 
    * **Revenue** - In 2021, Lemonade brought in 128.4M (10). It's YoY growth rate is 36% (10). 
    * **Customer Growth** - In 2020, Lemonade added 357,684 customers to bring its total number of customers to 1,000,802 (12). It's customer growth rate in 2020 was 55.62% (12). Since 2018, Lemonade has increased its number of customers by 3.24x (12).
    * **Gross Written Premium** - the total value of all underwritten policies for Lemonade in 2020 was $214M (13).
        * Note: Written Premium are the main source of income for insurance company's revenues (14).

* Lemonade is still a much smaller company compared to the legacy insurance providers; while Lemonade's gross written premium in 2020 was 214M, State Farm's figures in 2021 total 70B, Progressive's was 48B, and Allstate reported 41B (13). 

* Compared to newer insuretech companies like Hippo and Root, Lemonade is performing relatively strongly with a reported revenue of 128M in 2021 (10). Hippo's 2021 revenue was 100M (15) and Root's 2021 revenue came out to $340M (16). While both Lemonade and Root offer auto insurance, auto insurance is Root's main product line whereas Lemonade's primary product is renter's insurance, which contributes to 91% of its customer base (12). Therefore, Hippo, a home insurance provider, is the better competitor comparison to Lemonade. 


## Recommendations:

* Although Lemonade already offers home, life, car, and pet insurance, it should consider offering two additional types of insurance: **health insurance** and **travel insurance**.
* Adding these two types of insurance would establish Lemonade as a one-stop-shop for all types of insurance. Customers can consolidate their insurance under one account. 
* Obviously, many individuals have health insurance covered by their employers or by the government, however offering private insurance for those that do not already have it will allow Lemonade to attract new types of customers. 
* Travel insurance also allows Lemonade to bring in new business; instead of buying travel insurance from one-off transactions with various airlines, customers can buy a blanket coverage that will help them in case something were to affect their travel itinerary. All in all, it makes the customer's experience that much more stress-free by working solely with their trusted insurance agency.
* As mentioned earlier, 91% of Lemonade's customer base buys renter's insurance (12). Adding health and travel insurance can help Lemonade diversify its customer pool and help them avoid risk in case another major player in home insurance arises.

* Lemonade would not require any additional technologies to offer these new products. Instead, it would levy its present catalog of technology to offer quick customer support, competitive prices, and easy-to-file claims.
* The fact that Lemonade already has the capacity to offer health and travel insurance makes it that much more of a feasible business innovation. They may have to consult regulatory agencies and consult some experts, but that is something that they have certainly already done to establish their present portfolio of products.
